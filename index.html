    <h2>🎬 Coming Soon: A Documentary on the Warm Haven Project</h2>
    <p>Your support isn’t just building shelters — it’s helping tell a story. This project will be the subject of an upcoming documentary that follows our journey from collecting plastic waste to distributing shelters to animals in need. The film will highlight the impact of compassion, innovation, and sustainability, and showcase the organizations and sponsors who make this work possible. By joining the project, you become part of this story.</p>
    <p>The documentary captures volunteer teams assembling shelters, animals benefiting directly, and community engagement in high-need areas. Sponsors and partners are highlighted, demonstrating their commitment to sustainability and animal welfare. It inspires global audiences by showing how practical, innovative solutions can create measurable social and environmental impact while offering a platform for sponsors to show their positive contributions.</p>

  <!-- Mission -->
  <section id="mission">
    <h2>🐾 The Mission</h2>
    <p>Every winter, countless stray cats and dogs struggle to survive freezing nights with nowhere to hide. Simultaneously, tons of plastic waste accumulate in landfills and oceans, causing environmental harm. The Warm Haven Project addresses both problems at once: turning recycled plastic into durable, insulated shelters that give animals a safe, warm place to rest.</p>
    <p><strong>💲 Every $15 donated builds one real shelter — and saves one life.</strong></p>
    <img src="IMG_9304.jpeg" alt="Row of Warm Haven shelters providing refuge to stray animals">
    <p>Each shelter is approximately 60 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm, large enough for an adult cat or small dog, with a removable fleece pad for added warmth. Our goal is to produce up to 1,000 shelters in the first phase, distributing them in urban and suburban areas with the highest stray animal populations.</p>
    <p>We coordinate with local animal welfare organizations to identify the most critical deployment sites. Early support allows us to secure bulk materials, train volunteer teams, and implement quality assurance checks to ensure each shelter is durable and weatherproof. By supporting the project before the official GoFundMe launch, sponsors help scale production efficiently and track impact transparently.</p>

  <!-- Dual Mission -->
  <section id="dual">
    <h2>♻️ A Dual Mission: Saving Animals and the Planet</h2>
    <p>Every donation creates a dual impact: giving discarded plastic a new purpose and providing life-saving shelters for animals. Each unit removes 1–2 kg of plastic from the waste stream and transforms it into a safe, insulated home.</p>
    <img src="IMG_9303.png" alt="Close-up of a single Warm Haven shelter made from recycled plastic">
    <p>Beyond environmental and animal welfare benefits, the project offers educational and community engagement opportunities. Volunteers, schools, and local organizations participate in shelter assembly and distribution workshops, learning sustainable practices and animal care while contributing to meaningful change. Each event can produce 50–100 shelters, enabling rapid expansion and measurable outcomes.</p>

    <h2>🏠 What Makes the Warm Haven Shelter Unique</h2>
    <p>Our shelters are carefully engineered to balance affordability, durability, and animal comfort. They are built to withstand the toughest weather while keeping animals safe, dry, and warm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recycled HDPE Shell:</strong> Lightweight, waterproof, and resistant to cracking or UV damage, sourced from recycled containers and industrial plastic.</li>
      <li><strong>Double-Walled Insulation:</strong> Hollow air-trap walls lined with recycled foam and reflective film maintain internal temperatures up to 15°C warmer than outside.</li>
      <li><strong>Soft Interior Fleece:</strong> Washable pads made from reclaimed textiles provide comfort and hygiene for the animals.</li>
      <li><strong>Windproof Door Flap:</strong> Transparent vinyl flap blocks cold winds and rain while allowing sunlight in.</li>
      <li><strong>Stackable Modular Design:</strong> Units snap together to create colony shelters for multiple animals in high-density areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather-Tested Design:</strong> Rounded edges and reinforced joints resist wind lift and allow snow and rain to shed efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each shelter is easy for volunteers to assemble without special tools, allowing rapid deployment. Quality checks ensure every unit meets rigorous safety and durability standards before reaching animals.</p>

  <!-- Future -->
  <section id="future">
    <h2>🌍 A Future Built from Recycled Hope</h2>
    <p>The Warm Haven Project aims to expand nationally with regional manufacturing hubs, reducing transportation impact and speeding up deployment. Future plans include community recycling programs, volunteer training workshops, and educational initiatives to teach sustainable practices and animal welfare awareness.</p>
    <p>Each shelter built demonstrates how compassion and sustainability intersect, creating measurable environmental and social benefits. With continued support, this model can be scaled globally, providing safe refuge to stray animals and promoting responsible plastic use.</p>
