    <p>Turning Waste Into Warmth — Transforming recycled plastic into life-saving shelters for animals in need.</p>
    <p>Every shelter funded is a direct, tangible way to save a life and give discarded plastic a second purpose. Your support helps us bring warmth, safety, and hope to stray cats and dogs during the harshest winters.</p>

    <h2>🎬 Coming Soon: A Documentary on the Warm Haven Project</h2>
    <p>Your support isn’t just building shelters — it’s helping tell a story. This project will be the subject of an upcoming documentary that follows our journey from collecting plastic waste to distributing shelters to animals in need. The film will highlight the impact of compassion, innovation, and sustainability, and showcase the organizations and sponsors who make this work possible. By joining the project, you become part of this story.</p>

  <!-- Mission -->
  <section id="mission">
    <h2>🐾 The Mission</h2>
    <p>Every winter, countless stray cats and dogs struggle to survive freezing nights with nowhere to hide. Simultaneously, tons of plastic waste accumulate in landfills and oceans, causing environmental harm. The Warm Haven Project addresses both problems at once: turning recycled plastic into durable, insulated shelters that give animals a safe, warm place to rest.</p>
    <p><strong>💲 Every $15 donated builds one real shelter — and saves one life.</strong></p>

    <p>Our goal is to provide immediate relief for animals in need while promoting sustainability and creating a scalable model that can be adopted in communities worldwide.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Dual Mission -->
  <section id="dual">
    <h2>♻️ A Dual Mission: Saving Animals and the Planet</h2>
    <p>When you donate, you’re doing two incredible things at once. Not only are you giving discarded plastic a new purpose instead of letting it harm the environment, but you’re also creating life-saving shelters for stray animals who would otherwise face harsh conditions.</p>
    <p>Each shelter is a small but powerful step toward reducing plastic waste and increasing animal welfare. Your contribution has direct, visible results — every unit built keeps an animal safe and helps clean our planet.</p>

    <h2>🏠 What Makes the Warm Haven Shelter Unique</h2>
    <p>Our shelters are carefully engineered to balance affordability, durability, and animal comfort. They are built to withstand the toughest weather while keeping animals safe, dry, and warm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recycled Plastic Shell:</strong> Lightweight, waterproof, and resilient against snow, rain, and heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Double-Walled Insulation:</strong> Air-trapping hollow core with recycled foam and reflective lining keeps the inside up to 15°C warmer than outside.</li>
      <li><strong>Soft Interior:</strong> Includes a washable fleece pad made from recycled textiles for a warm, comfortable base.</li>
      <li><strong>Windproof Door Flap:</strong> Flexible vinyl blocks wind and rain while letting in daylight to keep the interior cozy.</li>
      <li><strong>Stackable & Modular:</strong> Snap-fit panels allow shelters to be connected for colonies of animals.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather-Tested Design:</strong> Rounded edges resist wind lift and efficiently shed snow or rain to extend durability over multiple seasons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every detail is optimized so that even a small, recycled structure can provide long-term protection for animals in need.</p>
