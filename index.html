    <h2>🎬 Coming Soon: A Documentary on the Warm Haven Project</h2>
    <p>Your support isn’t just building shelters — it’s helping tell a story. This project will be the subject of an upcoming documentary that follows our journey from collecting plastic waste to distributing shelters to animals in need. The film will highlight the impact of compassion, innovation, and sustainability, and showcase the organizations and sponsors who make this work possible. By joining the project, you become part of this story.The Warm Haven Project will be the focus of an upcoming documentary that captures the journey from collecting discarded plastic to distributing shelters in neighborhoods and urban areas with high stray animal populations. The film will follow our volunteer teams, manufacturing process, and the animals who benefit directly from the shelters.
    Sponsors and partners will be highlighted, showcasing their contribution to the project. This documentary is designed to inspire viewers worldwide by demonstrating how innovative, sustainable solutions can create meaningful social and environmental change. It also provides a platform for sponsors to share their commitment to positive impact with a broad audience.</p>

  <section id="mission">
    <h2>🐾 The Mission</h2>
    <p>Every winter, countless stray cats and dogs struggle to survive freezing nights with nowhere to hide. Simultaneously, tons of plastic waste accumulate in landfills and oceans, causing environmental harm. The Warm Haven Project addresses both problems at once: turning recycled plastic into durable, insulated shelters that give animals a safe, warm place to rest.</p>
    <p><strong>💲 Every $15 donated builds one real shelter — and saves one life.</strong></p>
    <img src="IMG_9304.jpeg" alt="Row of Warm Haven shelters providing refuge to stray animals">
    <p>Our goal is to provide immediate relief for animals in need while promoting sustainability and creating a scalable model that can be adopted in communities worldwide. Every winter, thousands of stray animals suffer from exposure, frostbite, and starvation. At the same time, millions of tons of plastic enter landfills and oceans, threatening ecosystems. The Warm Haven Project addresses these problems simultaneously by converting recycled HDPE plastic into insulated shelters designed to withstand extreme weather.
    Each shelter is approximately 60 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm, large enough for an adult cat or small dog to enter comfortably, with a removable fleece pad for added warmth. We focus on cost-efficiency to ensure that every $15 donation produces one high-quality shelter, enabling us to scale production rapidly and reach as many animals as possible.
    Early support allows us to secure materials in bulk, coordinate volunteer distribution teams, and implement quality checks to ensure every shelter is weatherproof and long-lasting.</p>

  <!-- Dual Mission -->
  <section id="dual">
    <h2>♻️ A Dual Mission: Saving Animals and the Planet</h2>
    <p>When you donate, you’re doing two incredible things at once. Not only are you giving discarded plastic a new purpose instead of letting it harm the environment, but you’re also creating life-saving shelters for stray animals who would otherwise face harsh conditions.</p>
    <p>Each shelter is a small but powerful step toward reducing plastic waste and increasing animal welfare. Your contribution has direct, visible results — every unit built keeps an animal safe and helps clean our planet.</p>
    <img src="IMG_9303.png" alt="Close-up of a single Warm Haven shelter made from recycled plastic">
    <p>The Warm Haven Project is a unique initiative that tackles two major global issues at once: animal welfare and environmental sustainability. By recycling HDPE plastic that would otherwise pollute landfills or oceans, we transform waste into life-saving resources.
    Each shelter keeps a small but meaningful amount of plastic out of the waste stream while providing a safe, insulated home for a stray animal. By donating, you are supporting both the reduction of environmental harm and the protection of vulnerable animals.
    Additionally, the project has an educational component: volunteers, schools, and local organizations can learn about sustainable practices and animal welfare while participating in shelter assembly and distribution, creating community engagement and awareness around environmental and humanitarian issues.</p>

    <h2>🏠 What Makes the Warm Haven Shelter Unique</h2>
    <p>Our shelters are carefully engineered to balance affordability, durability, and animal comfort. They are built to withstand the toughest weather while keeping animals safe, dry, and warm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recycled HDPE Shell:</strong> Lightweight, waterproof, and resistant to cracking or UV damage, sourced from recycled containers and industrial plastic</li>
      <li><strong>Double-Walled Insulation:</strong> Hollow air-trap walls lined with recycled foam and reflective film maintain internal temperatures up to 15°C warmer than outside.</li>
      <li><strong>Soft Interior Fleece:</strong> Washable pads made from reclaimed textiles provide comfort and hygiene for the animals</li>
      <li><strong>Windproof Door Flap:</strong> Transparent vinyl flap blocks cold winds and rain while allowing sunlight in.</li>
      <li><strong>Stackable Modular Design:</strong> Units snap together to create colony shelters for multiple animals in high-density areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather-Tested Design:</strong> Rounded edges and reinforced joints resist wind lift and allow snow and rain to shed efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each shelter is designed to be easy for volunteers to assemble without special tools, allowing rapid deployment to communities in need. Quality checks ensure that every shelter meets rigorous safety and durability standards before it reaches animals.</p>
